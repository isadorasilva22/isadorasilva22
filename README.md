# About Me
 
 I'm 21 years old and I started thinking about study technology watching people at work. I started college a year ago and I can't wait to keep learning more and more!
 
# Languages

  Currently I'm enrolled in a Systems Analysis and Development course. In this course I've learned about Python and some of its libraries, SQL Language and Web Development (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript), for example. I want to focus more in Python, JavaScript and later I want to learn more about the front-end area, focusing in CSS and some frameworks like React and Angular.
